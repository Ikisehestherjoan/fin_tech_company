CASE STUDY:PAYSECS FINTECH
PaySecs is a Fintech Company with over 5000 active users located in Nigeria and Kenya. They currently have Data Analysts whose daily tasks involve delivering analyzed data to the department heads and board members weekly. The analysts have recently experienced delayed data retrieval and the need for multiple checks on data accuracy as their daily transactions grew. After much complaint, the business has decided to adopt the services of a Big Data Engineer.
STEPS I TOOK TO SOLVE THE BUSINESS PROBLEM .
1. Assess the Current Data Infrastructure:
As the newly hired Big Data Engineer, I started by evaluating PaySecs's existing data infrastructure in both Nigeria and Kenya. Understand the data sources, storage systems, and data processing methods currently in use.
2. Identify Data Bottlenecks and Challenges:
 I Collaborate closely with the Data Analysts and gather specific feedback on the issues they are facing. Understand the pain points related to data retrieval delays and accuracy checks.
3. Define Project Objectives and Scope:
 I Worked with the business stakeholders to clearly define the objectives of the Big Data Engineering project. Is the goal to reduce data retrieval times, improve data accuracy, or both?
4. Plan for Data Collection and Integration:
 I Developed a comprehensive strategy for collecting and integrating data from various sources relevant to PaySecs's operations in Nigeria and Kenya. Ensuring data quality and consistency.
5. Select Appropriate Big Data Technologies:
  Based on the project objectives and data volume, I choose the pandas  tools to build a scalable and efficient data processing pipeline.
6. Design and Implement Data Pipelines:
I Created data pipelines that automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data. Ensure these pipelines can handle the increasing volume of transactions.
7. Implement Data Quality Assurance Measures:
 I Introduce data quality checks and validation processes to minimize errors and ensure data accuracy before it reaches the analysts and stakeholders.
8. Optimize Performance:
 I Continuously monitor and optimize the data processing pipelines to reduce retrieval times and improve overall system performance.
9. Train Data Analysts and Stakeholders:
I  Provided training and support to Data Analysts and other stakeholders to ensure they can effectively utilize the new data infrastructure and tools
10. Evaluate and Iterate:
I Regularly assess the impact of the Big Data Engineering efforts on data retrieval times and accuracy. Make necessary adjustments and improvements based on feedback and evolving business needs.
11. Document and Communicate Progress:
I Maintained detailed documentation of the project's progress and outcomes. Regularly communicate updates to department heads and board members to build trust and transparency.
12. Ensure Data Security and Compliance:
 I Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive financial data and ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations in Nigeria and Kenya.
13. Scale for Future Growth:
 I Developed a roadmap for scaling the Big Data infrastructure as PaySecs's user base and data volume continue to grow by using AWS cloud storage.
